## things missing

- win/lose condition
-some places i have you write the actual thing you want to select instead of a number, and im gonna change it to a number i promise
-some of the logic is a bit weird as in it asks you for the command at the end of your turn, i kind of want it so you can input those commands at anytime. not sure how to do that though
-idk some other stuff ive kind of lost interest, it was a bad decision to take on my passion project so early
